# Platformvania



### Description
A single player platform fighter that is inspired off of the metroidvania genre. The game also contains mechanics based off of platform fighters like Super Smash Bros.

### Simple Mechanics
As of right now the game has simple features like double, jumping, crouching, fast falling, gravity physics and semi solid platforms.

### Bugs
There was a bug involving the player collisions and the semi solid platform. The player would bounce off the sides of the semi solid platform like it was a solid object. Fixing this bug created 
a smoother way for the player to fall through the platform easier. Instead of holding "S" to fall through the platform, doublke pressing S felt smoother so I left it in the game.
